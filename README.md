# This project is a collection of recursive algorithms implemented in Java, addressing various tasks in mathematics, data processing, and string analysis. Designed for educational purposes, it aims to explore the concept of recursion and demonstrate its practical applications. Each solution utilizes a recursive approach to deepen understanding of this programming technique.
## Project Goals
### • To study and illustrate the use of recursion in problem-solving.
### • To provide examples of recursion in computations (factorial, exponentiation, GCD), array manipulation (minimum, average, reversal), property checking (prime numbers, digit-only strings), and combinatorics (Fibonacci numbers, binomial coefficients).
### • To lay the foundation for further exploration of recursive algorithm optimization.
## Task Overview
### 1 Finding the minimum element in an array.
### 2 Calculating the average of array elements.
### 3 Checking if a number is prime.
### 4 Computing the factorial of a number.
### 5 Determining the n-th Fibonacci number.
### 6 Raising a number to a power.
### 7 Reversing an array into a string without extra data structures.
### 8 Verifying if a string consists only of digits.
### 9 Calculating the binomial coefficient.
### 10 Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (Euclidean algorithm).
